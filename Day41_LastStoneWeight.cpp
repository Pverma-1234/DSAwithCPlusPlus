41. Last Stone Weight

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

</>CODE:


class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap(stones.begin(), stones.end());

        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int stone1 = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();  
            int stone2 = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop(); 

            if (stone1 != stone2) {
                maxHeap.push(stone1 - stone2);  
            }
        }

        return maxHeap.empty() ? 0 : maxHeap.top();  
    }
};
