119. Increment Submatrices by One

You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i, col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:

Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i, col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
Return the matrix mat after performing every query.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
- In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
- In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
Example 2:


Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
- In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 500
1 <= queries.length <= 104
0 <= row1i <= row2i < n
0 <= col1i <= col2i < n

</>CODE:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> rangeAddQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> diff(n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));

        for (auto& q : queries) {
            int r1 = q[0], c1 = q[1], r2 = q[2], c2 = q[3];

            diff[r1][c1] += 1;
            diff[r1][c2 + 1] -= 1;
            diff[r2 + 1][c1] -= 1;
            diff[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] += 1;
        }

        vector<vector<int>> ans(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            int rowSum = 0;
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                rowSum += diff[r][c];
                if (r > 0) rowSum += ans[r-1][c] - ans[r-1][c]; 
                ans[r][c] = rowSum;
                if (r > 0) ans[r][c] += ans[r-1][c];
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
